In ArkTS development, when you need to analyze the parameter value of a function call, you can follow these steps and make full use of the ArkTS_Assembly_Analysis MCP Server (especially its Resource functionality) to retrieve and analyze Panda Assembly format ArkTS assembly code and resource file in HarmonyOS package.

1. Get All Functions of the Target Module/Class: Use the ArkTS_Assembly_Analysis MCP Resource wildcard feature with a pattern like panda://*Name* to obtain a list of all functions and their assembly code for the target module or class. This will give you a comprehensive view of all possible functions, including lifecycle functions (e.g., aboutToAppear, onPageShow, func_main_0) and other initialization methods. For the module method name "&A.ets.B.C.#~@0>#aaa", the module name is "&A.ets.B.C" and the method name is "#~@0>#aaa". The splitting is based on the last dot (.) in the string.

2. Analyze Function Invocation Order: Carefully examine the retrieved assembly code, paying special attention to:

- Invocation Timing of Lifecycle Functions: The ArkTS Runtime calls lifecycle functions in a specific order (e.g., aboutToAppear is called after component creation but before build execution). Analyze the function call logic and sequence in the assembly code to determine their priority.
- Variable Initialization Process: Trace the source of assignments for the target variable (e.g., the parameter for setWebDebuggingAccess). Initialization might occur:
  - Directly with a literal value in the constructor or the lifecycle function.
  - By calling other functions and using their return value for assignment.
  - By reading values from HarmonyOS package resource files (e.g., resources/base/path/string.json or other configuration files) for initialization.

3. Check Resource Files (If needed): If the variable initialization logic indicates that its value comes from a resource file, you must use the ArkTS_Assembly_Analysis MCP Resource's file:// protocol (e.g., file://resources/base/path/string.json) to get the content of the corresponding resource file and parse the relevant key-value pairs to determine the variable's initial value.

4. Specific Function Analysis - setWebDebuggingAccess: For the call to setWebDebuggingAccess within the function &vulwebview.src.main.ets.pages.Index&.#~@0>#aboutToAppear:

- Use MCP Resource to get the detailed assembly code for this #~@0>#aboutToAppear function and the setWebDebuggingAccess function it calls.
- Analyze the Call Logic: Confirm whether this call actually exists on the execution path of #~@0>#aboutToAppear (check for conditional statements like if that might prevent its invocation).
- Determine the Parameter Value: Examine the value passed to setWebDebuggingAccess.
  - If the parameter is a literal value passed directly (like true or false), then confirm it directly.
  - If the parameter is a variable, you need to trace the initialization process of that variable (as described in steps 2 and 3) until you find its definitive initial value.

5. Final Determination: Based on the above analysis:

- Output True only if it is confirmed that setWebDebuggingAccess will be called within #~@0>#aboutToAppear (no unreachable conditions blocking it), and the parameter passed during the call resolves to true.
- Output False in all other scenarios (including: the function call is unreachable, the parameter value is not true by default, the parameter value cannot be determined, or any errors are encountered during analysis).

Note: The entire analysis process must rely solely on the Resource information provided by the ArkTS_Assembly_Analysis MCP Server, avoiding speculation. Be sure to use wildcards to obtain the code for all relevant functions, as variable initialization might be scattered across different functions.
